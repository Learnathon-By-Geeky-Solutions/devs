Okay, based on the features listed in your roamance-srs-client.md, here's a suggested frontend route structure using Next.js App Router conventions:

- **`/`**: Home / News Feed (Feature 1.12)
- **`/map`**: Interactive Map (Feature 1.1)
- **`/search`**: Full Text Search results page (Feature 1.11). Could potentially integrate RAG (2.2) and Visual Search (2.3) triggers here.
- **`/country/[countryId]`**: Dynamic route for specific Country Pages (Feature 1.2)
- **`/destinations`**: Browse/search destinations (Feature 1.3)
- **`/destinations/[destinationId]`**: Dynamic route for specific Destination details (Feature 1.3)
- **`/activities`**: Browse/search activities (Feature 1.4)
- **`/activities/[activityId]`**: Dynamic route for specific Activity details (Feature 1.4)
- **`/restaurants`**: Browse/search restaurants (Feature 1.5)
- **`/restaurants/[restaurantId]`**: Dynamic route for specific Restaurant details (Feature 1.5)
- **`/accommodations`**: Browse/search hotels/resorts (Feature 1.6)
- **`/accommodations/[accommodationId]`**: Dynamic route for specific Accommodation details (Feature 1.6)
- **`/transportation`**: Search flights/transport (Feature 1.7)
- **`/travel-plans`**: View user's or public travel plans (Feature 1.8)
- **`/travel-plans/new`**: Create a new travel plan (Feature 1.8). Could integrate Cost Estimation (1.9) and AI Itinerary Generator (2.1) here.

- **`/profile/[userId]`**: Dynamic route for viewing other users' profiles (Feature 1.13)

**Notes:**

- Features like Reviews (1.10), Post Creation (1.14), Caption Generation (2.4), and Cost Estimation (1.9) might be components or modals within other routes rather than dedicated pages.
- AI features (Section 2) are generally integrated into the relevant feature routes (e.g., AI Itinerary Generator within `/travel-plans/new`, RAG within `/search`).
- You already have `/`, `/map`, `/profile`, `/auth/sign-in`, and `/auth/sign-up` implemented.
